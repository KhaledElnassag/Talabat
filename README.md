In this project, I had the opportunity to implement a wide range of features that have transformed our application into a powerful and efficient platform. Let's explore the key highlights:

1️⃣ Generic Repository and Specification: Leveraging the power of the generic repository pattern and the flexibility of specifications, we achieved a modular and maintainable data access layer. This allowed us to decouple data retrieval logic from the business layer, resulting in clean and reusable code.

2️⃣ Unit of Work Design Pattern: By implementing the unit of work design pattern, we ensured consistency and reliability in managing database transactions. This pattern provided a structured approach to handling multiple database operations, simplifying complex workflows and improving data integrity.

3️⃣ AutoMapper: With AutoMapper, we streamlined the mapping process between our data transfer objects (DTOs) and domain models. This simplified the transformation of data structures and facilitated seamless communication between different layers of our application.

4️⃣ Client and Server-side Validation: We prioritized data integrity and user experience by implementing comprehensive validation techniques. With client-side validation, we provided immediate feedback to users, while server-side validation ensured strict data verification, guarding against invalid or malicious inputs.

5️⃣ Sort, Filter, and Pagination: To enhance usability and optimize data retrieval, we incorporated sorting, filtering, and pagination functionalities. Users can now efficiently search and navigate through large datasets, improving their overall experience.

6️⃣ Security Module with JWT Authentication and Authorization: We implemented a robust security module using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. This ensured that only authorized users could access sensitive API endpoints, protecting our application and user data.

7️⃣ Payment Module with Stripe Payment Gateway: By integrating the Stripe payment gateway, we enabled secure and seamless payment processing within our application. Users can confidently complete transactions, enjoying a frictionless payment experience.

8️⃣ Caching Module with Redis In-Memory Database: To optimize performance and minimize database load, we implemented a caching module using Redis, an in-memory database. By storing frequently accessed data in Redis, we reduced response times and improved overall system performance.

9️⃣ Admin Dashboard with ASP.NET MVC: We developed an intuitive admin dashboard using ASP.NET MVC, providing administrators with a comprehensive interface to manage and monitor various aspects of the application. This centralized hub empowered administrators to efficiently handle system configurations, user management, and data analytics.
